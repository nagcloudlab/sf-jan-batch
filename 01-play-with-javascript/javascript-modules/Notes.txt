commonjs module standard
-------------------------------

 rules

 -> every file is a module
 -> all variables and functions defined in a module are private unless explicitly exported
 -> to abstract/export a variable or function, use 'module.exports' object
 -> to import a module, use 'require' function
 -> group related modules in a folde as package, with a 'package.json' file

 node.js has a built-in module system based on commonjs standard
